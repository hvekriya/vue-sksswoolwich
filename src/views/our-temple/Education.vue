      <h1>Swaminarayan Education</h1>
    </header>

    <p>Swaminarayan Education has had many names over the years as it has morphed from a simple Gujarati Shaala to
      including classes for Mathematics and English. The main aim of the school is to give our students a distinct
      advantage over others by ensuring
      they achieve a grade 6 to 9 (A*-B) in their GCSE examinations. Previous students have often taken their GCSE’s
      earlier as a result of these classes. We currently have a very good record with around 95% of students achieving
      these grades in all
      3 subjects including students who do not have English as their first language.</p>
    <h3>Gujarati</h3>
    <p>Gujarati has been taught in the temple since it was first opened in 1988. It is the mother tongue of most of the
      devotees that attend the temple regularly. There are two major reasons why we continue to teach Gujarati:</p>
    <li>To be able to communicate with family and love ones back in India.</li>
    <li>To understand the scriptures of the Swaminarayan Sampraday, as they are mostly in Gujarati.</li>
    <br>
    <p>Levels taught: Ankodi, Balpothi, Dhoran 1, Dhoran 2 and GCSE.</p>
    <h3>Mathematics</h3>
    <p>Maths classes were introduced in 1995 which have helped many students achieve a greater understanding of the
      subject. The classes allow children to be introduced to higher levels much sooner than their peers and gain
      further
      practice on all subjects
      to solidify their knowledge in small classes ensuring the student gets as much help as they need.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Levels taught: KS1, KS2, KS3, GCSE and A-level.</p>
    <h3>English</h3>
    <p>This is the latest subject to be added to the school and now has been running for more than 5 years. English has
      always been a subject that our community has struggled with however having suitable teaching has ensured the
      students
      are leaving with
      better language skills and are better read. From adding English Literature and Language, we have noticed
      improvements
      in their performance in other subjects at school.</p>
    <p>In addition to focusing on the language & grammar skills, the teachers put a strong emphasis on reading a book
      or a
      comic daily as well as showing how this can improve the students’ language almost instantaneously.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Levels taught: KS1, KS2, KS3 and GCSE.</p>

    <p>Please ensure they are aged 5 and will be turning 6 in the current academic year.</p>
