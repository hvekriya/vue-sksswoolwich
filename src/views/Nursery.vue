      <h4>Did You Know?</h4>
      <p>In England since September 2010, all three and four year olds are entitled to 15 hours of free nursery
        education
        for
        38 weeks of the year. Early Years education takes place in a variety of settings including state nursery
        schools,
        nursery classes and reception classes within primary schools, as well as settings outside the state sector such
        as
        voluntary pre-schools, privately run nurseries or childminders. In recent years there has been a major
        expansion
        of Early Years education and childcare. The Education Act 2002 extended the National Curriculum for England to
        include
        the Foundation Stage which was first introduced in September 2000, and covered children’s education from the
        age
        of 3 to the end of the reception year, when children are aged 5. </p>
      <h4>Our Plans</h4>
      <p>With further changes to come within the education system in the UK, we would like to plan in advance and offer
        education and care for children aged 18 months to 4 years. This nursery will be different from any other in the
        area as we will be able to offer cultural and religious morals to advance every child’s development. As the
        nursery
        is in the initial stages of planning, there are likely to be some changes, below you will find some information
        to
        give you a better understanding of what we have to offer. </p>
      <h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
      <p>What size is the nursery?</p>
      <p><code>We would have the capacity for approximately 15 in the age band of 18 months to 2 years, 16 in the 2 to
          3
          years age band and 16 in the 3 to 4 years band</code></p>
      <p>What are the hours for the nursery?</p>
      <p><code>The nursery aims to run full time (8am to 5pm) and also offer part time hours which make up a minimum of
          15
          hours within a week, these times are yet to be confirmed.</code></p>

      <p>Would snacks and meals be provided?</p>
      <p><code>Yes, breakfast, lunch and teatime will be offered at set times throughout the day. Food provided will be
          a
          healthy and balanced vegetarian diet, in the form of a variety of cuisines.</code></p>

      <p>Who would be minding and teaching the children?</p>
      <p><code>The nursery aims to have staff qualified at level 2 or above in Early Years Practitioners, all staff
          will
          undergo an induction period, and will attend Paediatric First Aid training, Food & Hygiene, and Safeguarding
          Children.  We will ensure this training is continually updated and refreshed.</code></p>

      <p>What will the children learn?</p>
      <p><code>The Nursery will educate students following the EYFS ‘7 areas of learning’ as well as embedding the
          fundamentals of the Hinduism culture with daily Prathna and weekly visits to the main Mandir. Focus will also
          be
          placed on the learning and understanding of other cultures as well as specialist activities i.e. Yoga, Music
          and
          Language. </code></p>

      <p>Will the nursery be Ofsted registered?</p>
      <p><code>Yes, as is the Ghanshyam Nursery in Kenton, from whom we would take guidance from.</code></p>

      <p>Who will be running and governing the nursery?</p>
      <p><code>The nursery will be organised under the SKS Swaminarayan South East London Temple umbrella and will take
          advice from the Ghansyham nursery as part of the SKSS Temple Kenton, though aims to run independently. </code></p>

      <p>What happens if I am delayed in collecting my child?</p>
      <p><code>Sometimes parents are unavoidably delayed.  Please let us know as soon as possible to avoid unnecessary
          concerns.  Arrangements will be made to look after your child until you arrive.  In the event that you are
          more
          than 15 minutes late, we will have to make an additional charge to cover staff costs.</code></p>

      <p>What happens when my child starts nursery?</p>
      <p><code>We would want to find out as much as possible about your child, their routine, home life, what they do
          and
          don’t like, allergies, sleep patterns and any celebrations you wouldn’t want your child to participate in at
          the
          nursery. An induction would also compromise of a home visit to gage the child’s comfort and familiar
          surroundings. There will be a home link book for children from the age of 2 to give guidance on the child’s
          progress and development, newsletters and screen to give details of weekly past and upcoming events. </code></p>

      <p>What is a key person?</p>
      <p><code>Every child attending the Nursery is assigned a key person.  The role of a key person is to assist in
          the
          learning of each child to help them reach their full potential and works closely with the child and their
          parents/guardians. Your child’s key person is responsible for compiling your child's Learning Diary folder. A
          Learning Diary is a collection of written and photographic evidence relating to your child's development and
          progress whilst they are at the Nursery.</code></p>

      <p>How much will it cost for my child to attend the Nursery?</p>
      <p><code>TBC</code></p>

      <p>My child is 3 years old how do I get free funding form the government?</p>
      <p><code>All three and four year olds are entitled to 15 hours (A full day and a half day) of free nursery
          education
          in the term following their 3rd birthday, for 38 weeks of the year. This applies until they reach compulsory
          school age (the term following their fifth birthday). We will apply for your free funding from the local
          authority for the term after your child reaches three years old and the funding will be deducted from your
          nursery fees.</code></p>

      <p>Who can get free early learning?</p>

          Royal
          Greenwich, this is dependent on certain criteria such as if your child has additional needs or if your family
          receives any of the following benefits: Income-based Job Seekers Allowance, Income Support, Child Tax Credit
          and/or Working Tax Credit (your annual gross income mustn't be over £16,190), Disability Related Working Tax
